Hromadné stahování JŘ ODIS / 
Bulk downloading of timetables from the ODIS public transport system in Northern Moravia and (a part of) Silesia (these lands are located in the north-eastern part of the Czech Republic, in case you happen not to know it :-) ).
Trying to refactor the code (time permitting) and introduce the idiomatic error-handling based on the Result type instead of my own railway-oriented error handling.
